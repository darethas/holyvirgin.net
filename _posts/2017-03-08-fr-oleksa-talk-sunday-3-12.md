Fr. Oleksa is coming to give a talk on the Three Alaskan Saints.

From the flyer, "Come hear more about three Alaskan saints and their missionary significance for today. We will hear of the joy and courage of Saint Herman, the commitment and vision of Saint Innocent and the long-suffering and Paschal joy of Saint Jacob as essential to our missionary task in North America."
