We welcome you to the new look and feel of the virtual home of Nativity of the Holy Virgin OCA Orthodox Church in Charlotte,
NC. As the mission says in the bottom, we exist as a community to offer praise, thanksgiving, and worship to the
biblical God, the Father, who revealed himself through his Son Jesus Christ and who sent his life creating Holy Spirit
like a Dove on the Multitudes on the day of Pentecost when he formed His Church, a Tradition we continue to abide
in, in continuity from that date until this day. Come "Taste and See" that the Lord is good, and stop on by. We would
love to have you be a member of our growing family. We are located in the historical Derita neighborhood at 1700
Mineral Springs Road in Charlotte.
