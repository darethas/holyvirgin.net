        <h2>Scrips Program</h2>
        <h4><a href="https://www.shopwithscrip.com/featured-scrip-retailers">Click Here for Available Retailers</a></h4>
        <p>With Scrips, you buy gift cards for your everyday purchases such as retail stores, gas stations, restaurants, hotels,
            airlines and more -- and our church earns money on every purchase.
        </p>
        <p>This has been a successful program for many nonprofits, including churches. As participation increases, our earnings
            increase.
        </p>

            <li>2. Decide on stores, dollar amount, and quantity of cards you wish to order using the link above to view the
                available retailers.</li>
            <li>3. Bring your order form, cash or check to church to place your order. Checks should be made out to NHVOC with

        </ul>
        <p>
        It is important to pay for your cards in advance, so that the church can use the funds to buy the cards.

        Your orders will be placed on Monday and will be available for you to pick up the following Sunday. 
        </p>

            The church will have a limited weekly inventory of scrip cards such as Walmart, Food Lion, Target, Starbucks, etc on hand for you to purchase.
