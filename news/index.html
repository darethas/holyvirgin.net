        <h3>Welcome to Our New Website!</h3>
        <h6><em>Posted by: Webmaster on Sunday November 20th, 2016</em></h6>
        <p>We welcome you to the new look and feel of the virtual home of Nativity of the Holy Virgin OCA Orthodox Church in
          Charlotte, NC. As the mission says in the bottom, we exist as a community to offer praise, thanksgiving, and worship
          to the biblical God, the Father, who revealed himself through his Son Jesus Christ and who sent his life creating
          Holy Spirit like a Dove on the Multitudes on the day of Pentecost when he formed His Church, a Tradition we continue
          to abide in, in continuity from that date until this day. Come "Taste and See" that the Lord is good, and stop
          on by. We would love to have you be a member of our growing family. We are located in the historical Derita neighborhood
          at 1700 Mineral Springs Road in Charlotte.
