And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the form of men, but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.... As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in front; the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at the back. Such were their faces.... (Ez. 1:3-6, 10).</p><h5><b>Other Symbols.</b></h5><p>All-Seeing Eye: The All-Seeing Eye of God looks out from the triangle, which represents the Trinity.

The letters of the Greek word for fish, also signify the first letters of each word of the phrase Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.</p><p>Grapes: A bunch of grapes signifies the Sacrament of the Holy Communion. It also is a symbol of Christ the Fruit of Life.</p><p>Lamb of God: This symbol emphasizes the sacrificial role of Christ (John 1:29).

The leaf is one, yet distinct, equal, and of the same substance.</p><p>Ship: The Church has been likened to a great ship bearing men through a violent storm to the safety of the Kingdom of Heaven. The main part of the church building is called the Nave, which comes from the Latin word for ship, navis.</p><p>Ten Commandments: These are pictured as tablets of stone, with numbers on each, symbolizing the Ten Commandments. Sometimes there are three commandments on the first and seven on the second; sometimes there are four and six; and sometimes there are five on each tablet.</p><p>Triquetra: This is an early symbol of the Trinity in which the three equal arcs express eternity in their continuous form, indivisible in their weaving.</p><p>Triquetra and Circle: The Triquetra, denoting the Trinity, is combined with the circle of eternity, producing a figure recalling several spiritual truths.</p><p>Wheat: Wheat is the symbol of the Bread of Life, based on the Gospel of Mark</p>
